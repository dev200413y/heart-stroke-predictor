# Heart Stroke Prediction App

## Overview

The Heart Stroke Prediction App is an intuitive web-based tool designed to help users assess their risk of heart stroke quickly and reliably. By inputting basic health parameters, users receive instant, data-driven insights powered by advanced machine learning models. This empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their heart health and take proactive measures for prevention.

## Features

* **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy input of health data through a simple web form.
* **Instant Risk Assessment:** Real-time prediction of heart stroke risk.
* **Reliable Machine Learning:** Powered by a pre-trained K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.
* **Accessible Anywhere:** Runs directly in the browser using Streamlit, no installation required.
* **Supports Preventive Healthcare:** Encourages early awareness and intervention.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Streamlit (for web interface)
* scikit-learn (machine learning model)
* joblib (model serialization)

## Installation and Usage

1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Access the app via your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Future Roadmap

* Expand input parameters for more personalized predictions.
* Integrate additional health insights and recommendations.
